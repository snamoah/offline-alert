# Offline Alert

## Background
In my line of work, I have to always be online and ready for communication. Here in Ghana, I can't say we have that much of stable internet. My first step to helping myself make sure I'm always online is to first know as early as possible if I'm offline then switch to my backup internet provider. 

That is what this simple tool is supposed to help me achieve. Some day, I can work on the automatic connection to backup internet provider. I know the OS does that sometimes but in the case where you're out of credit, you might be connected to the network but not to the internet and that, the OS can't help.

I'm still no where yet and currently I just have to run `node index.js` to figure if I'm offline

I'll work on making it a daemon soon.
